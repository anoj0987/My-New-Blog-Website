            <p>The Digital Immune System is a software-based security framework designed to protect computer systems
                from various types of malware, cyber-attacks, and other digital threats. Inspired by the biological
                immune system, it aims to detect, respond to, and mitigate security threats in real-time.</p><br>
            <h2>Key Components</h2><br>
            <h3>1. Threat Detection:</h3><p>Utilizes various techniques such as anomaly detection, behavior analysis, and
            signature-based detection to identify potential threats.</p><br><h3>2. Automatic Response:</h3><p>Once a threat is
            detected, the system automatically takes actions to neutralize it, such as isolating the infected
            components, blocking malicious traffic, or patching vulnerabilities.</p><br><h3>3. Learning and Adaptation:</h3>
            <p>Continuously learns from new threats and adapts to evolving attack vectors, enhancing its ability to protect
            the system over time.</p><br><h3>4. Collaboration:</h3><p>Can share threat intelligence with other systems or networks,
            creating a collective defense mechanism that strengthens the overall security posture.</p><br><h3>5. Resilience:
            </h3><p>Designed to be robust and resistant to attacks, ensuring that the system can recover quickly from
            security breaches and continue functioning with minimal disruption.</p><br><h2>Applications</h2><br>
            <p><b> Enterprise Security:</b> Protects corporate networks and systems from cyber threats</p>

            <p><b> Cloud Security:</b>Defends cloud-based applications and infrastructure.</p>
            <p><b>IoT Security:</b>Safeguards Internet of Things devices and ecosystems.</p>The Digital Immune System
            represents an advanced approach to cybersecurity, focusing on proactive and adaptive defense strategies to
            protect against an ever-changing landscape of digital threats.
