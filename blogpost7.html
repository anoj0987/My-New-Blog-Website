            <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform
                tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of
                developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability
                to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since their development in the
                1940s, digital computers have been programmed to carry out very complex tasks—such as discovering proofs
                for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Despite continuing advances in
                computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match full human
                flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some
                programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in executing certain
                specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as
                diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots.
            </p><br>
            <h2>What is intelligence?</h2>All but the simplest human behavior is ascribed to intelligence, while even
            the most complicated insect behavior is usually not taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the
            difference? Consider the behavior of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to
            her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and
            only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s instinctual
            behavior is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is
            inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced.
            Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of the wasp—must include the ability to adapt to new
            circumstances.
            </p><br>
            <h2>Learning</h2>
            <p>There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence.
                The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple computer program for solving
                mate-in-one
                chess problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution
                with
                the position so that, the next time the computer encountered the same position, it would recall the
                solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively
                easy to implement on a computer. More challenging is the problem of implementing what is called
                generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations. For
                example, a
                program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past
                tense of a word such as jump unless the program was previously presented with jumped, whereas a program
                that
                is able to generalize can learn the “add -ed” rule for regular verbs ending in a consonant and so form
                the
                past tense of jump on the basis of experience with similar verb.</p><br>

            <h2>Problem solving</h2>
            <p> Problem solving, particularly in artificial intelligence, may be characterized as a systematic search
                through a
                range of possible actions in order to reach some predefined goal or solution. Problem-solving methods
                divide into
                special purpose and general purpose. A special-purpose method is tailor-made for a particular problem
                and often
                exploits very specific features of the situation in which the problem is embedded. In contrast, a
                general-purpose
                method is applicable to a wide variety of problems. One general-purpose technique used in AI is
                means-end analysis—a
                step-by-step, or incremental, reduction of the difference between the current state and the final goal.
                The program
                selects actions from a list of means—in the case of a simple robot, this might consist of PICKUP,
                PUTDOWN,
                MOVEFORWARD, MOVEBACK, MOVELEFT, and MOVERIGHT—until the goal is reached. </p><br>

            <h2>Large language models and natural language processing</h2>
            <p>Natural language processing (NLP) involves analyzing
                how computers can process and parse language similarly to the way humans do. To do this, NLP models must
                use
                computational linguistics, statistics, machine learning, and deep-learning models. Early NLP models were
                hand-coded
                and rule-based but did not account for exceptions and nuances in language. Statistical NLP was the next
                step, using
                probability to assign the likelihood of certain meanings to different parts of text. Modern NLP systems
                use
                deep-learning models and techniques that help them to “learn” as they process information.</p><br>

            <h2>AI technology</h2>
            <p>In the early 21st century faster processing power and larger datasets (“big data”) brought
                artificial intelligence out of computer science departments and into the wider world. Moore’s law, the
                observation
                that computing power doubled roughly every 18 months, continued to hold true. The stock responses of the
                early
                chatbot Eliza fit comfortably within 50 kilobytes; the language model at the heart of ChatGPT was
                trained on 45
                terabytes of text.</p>
